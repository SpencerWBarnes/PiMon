// This library was written as a Software Engineering Senior Project for

// Authors: Spencer Barnes, Jordan Stremming, Tyler Whiticker, Jake Griesmer

// Provide functions to assist in the recieving of data and logs from an 
//  Arduino board. To be used in conjunction with JsonSerial Stream library
// This library is intended to be expanded upon to handle more data types.
