PiMon is developed with the following libraries:
* Bootstrap 4.3.1
* Bootswatch (Darkly Theme)
* Python + Flask

## What are *.jinja2 files?
In a nutshell, they're fancy HTML files via templates.
You can write HTML code like normal. However, jinja2 allows you to
write basic Python statements and use "blocks" to template off
sections.
